Here's why:\n\n1. The first requirement is about displaying the Critical Path in a project management tool. This involves identifying tasks that have no slack time and thus any delay in these tasks will cause delays to the entire project.\n\n2. The second requirement is about creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) class for task properties, which allows users to add or remove dependencies between tasks using an object of the dependency collection. This is more focused on user interaction and data management within the software tool itself.\n\nWhile both requirements are related to tasks in some way, they serve different purposes and do not directly depend on each other. Therefore, they are not related in a way that would imply one requirement cannot be implemented without the other.","ff0f0ba0-90ab-3662-b429-75a352af0768":"No.","93b7fb4d-ad0c-3406-8dae-db21f921217a":"Yes, these two requirements are related. Here's why:\n\n1. The first requirement discusses adding/removing resources to tasks dependencies, indicating that there is a relationship between tasks and the resources assigned to them.\n2. The second requirement mentions deleting a task from the calendar using the `GanttProject` class, which involves adjusting allocated resources and links to other tasks.\n\nThe common element in both requirements is \"tasks\" and \"resources\". The first requirement talks about managing dependencies between them, while the second requirement discusses how deleting a task affects these dependencies. Therefore, they are related as they both deal with the same core entities (tasks and resources) and their relationships."}
