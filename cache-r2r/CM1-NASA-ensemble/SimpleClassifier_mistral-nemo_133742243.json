Both requirements relate to error handling in the DPU-CCM software, specifically focusing on unrecoverable software errors:\n\n1. The first requirement states that when an unrecoverable software error occurs (leading to a loss of commandability or ground communication), the system should record an error to the LAST_BOOT_IVEC location in EEPROM and stop strobing the Watchdog Timer.\n\n2. The second requirement discusses how errors are handled, including scenarios where errors might be lost if multiple errors occur before the main task (ccmTask()) runs. It introduces a global variable `ccmISRerror` to temporarily store error codes when called from an interrupt context, which is then queued by `ccmTask()` when it executes.\n\nThese two requirements are related because they both deal with managing and handling errors in different contexts within the DPU-CCM software.","4e09f9dc-a73c-3249-a526-16b12d53e2f2":"Yes, these two requirements are related. The first requirement specifies that DPU-TMALI should communicate with DPU-DCI using the DCI Interface. The second requirement describes a specific sequence of data exchange between DPU-TMALI (TMALI) and another component called DPA CSC. Since TMALI is part of DPU-TMALI, these two requirements together describe how DPU-TMALI communicates with other components to collect EVENTs using the DCI Interface.","092feee3-8068-3cac-ada5-f0338802b21c":"No.","34840e24-9bce-3916-9854-a6909ba7cebc":"Yes, these two requirements are related. The first requirement states that the DPU-CCM should provide a mechanism for other CSCs (Control System Components) to report errors for inclusion in the DPU_HK (DPU Housekeeping). The second requirement describes how the TMALI CSC collects housekeeping data and makes it available via a function call (`tmaliHkGet()`), with this data being returned through the `TMALI_HK` data structure.\n\nThe connection between these two requirements is that they both deal with housekeeping data management, but from different perspectives. The first requirement focuses on error reporting, while the second requirement details how one specific CSC (TMALI) handles its own housekeeping data. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that errors reported by other CSCs might be included in the DPU_HK, which could potentially include TMALI_HK data as well.","23ae555b-224e-3a4a-abfa-53d3d88e4e1d":"No, these two requirements are not directly related. Here's why:\n\n1. The first requirement is about configuring a timeout value for the DCI interface at startup, with an option to modify it dynamically. This is a configuration setting that happens once during initialization.\n\n2. The second requirement describes a sequence of operations performed by the DPA CSC (Data Plane Adapter Communication Subsystem) involving function calls (`tmaliWait()` and `tmaliNextEvent()`) to collect events from TMALI (Transport Management Agent Library Interface). This is about data exchange and event handling, not configuration.\n\nWhile both requirements involve TMALI, they serve different purposes and do not reference each other. Therefore, they are not directly related.","fc97b2b3-1958-3bcc-ae75-f6efb611adf3":"No, these two requirements are not related. The first requirement is about implementing a mechanism for incremental memory loads and dumps in the DPU-CCM (Data Plane Unit - Central Control Module), while the second requirement is about activating and controlling hardware windowing functionality via a specific function (`tmaliDciWindowSet()`) in the DCI (Data Center Infrastructure). These two functionalities serve different purposes and do not directly relate to each other.","ed1bea46-c2d8-3623-bdc0-f0a1cd07a8e8":"Yes, these two requirements are related. The first requirement specifies that the DPU-CCM (Data Plane Unit - Command Control Module) should maintain counts of successfully received and rejected commands, while the second requirement states that the DPU produces eight types of housekeeping packets for control and monitoring purposes. Since DPU_HK (DPU Housekeeping) is mentioned in the first requirement and housekeeping packets are mentioned in the second requirement, it implies that these counts could be reported via one or more of the eight types of housekeeping packets produced by the DPU. Therefore, they are related as they both pertain to the DPU's reporting functionality.","7d809bc8-10e2-35e2-b3ad-585d538f9721":"No, these two requirements are not related. The first requirement is about a specific hardware component (DPU-TMALI) and its interaction with another component called TMALI_HK, while the second requirement is about error handling in software during boot time using global task variable errno and error queues.

The first requirement is asking for a feature that allows large memory operations to be done incrementally, while the second artifact describes a ring buffer data structure with pointers `pIn` and `pOut`, which could be used to implement such an incremental mechanism. For example, instead of loading or dumping all data at once, one could use this ring buffer to process data in chunks by moving `pIn` or `pOut` incrementally.","41f57b24-e638-381c-b402-bf7f9870fb82":"Yes, these two requirements are related.

The first requirement discusses the need for incremental memory loads and dumps, suggesting a mechanism that handles large amounts of data over time rather than all at once. The second requirement describes how commands are handled in the DPU-CCM system, including the use of queues to manage incoming commands from different interfaces (SCU via 1553 and ICU via SSI). Since the first requirement mentions memory loads and dumps, which could involve handling large amounts of data, it's reasonable to assume that this mechanism would interact with the command handling system described in the second requirement. Therefore, they are related.","dac9eb7d-98ec-3b72-a4c5-cc03d589910f":"Yes, these two requirements are related. They both refer to a ring buffer used for storing incoming data frames, with one requirement specifying the size and initialization details of this buffer (the DPU-TMALI requirement), and the other describing how this ring buffer is implemented and managed internally by the system (the CSC requirement). The TMALI_BUFFER_SIZE mentioned in the first requirement is likely used as the size parameter for the ring buffer described in the second requirement.","9617495e-636e-3209-b017-9ba8c506d061":"Yes. The two requirements are related as they both pertain to the same software component, the TMALI (Time Measurement and Alignment Library).

It explains how commands are dequeued, processed, and executed by the Command Dispatch Task (`ccmCmdTask()`). This task maintains counts for both rejected and executed commands and handles special cases like 1 Hz Clock Time messages and Attitude messages from the spacecraft. Additionally, it ensures that the task reports periodically to the CCM Control Task in the absence of ground commands.\n\nBoth requirements are concerned with the functionality and behavior of the DPU-TMALI software component, indicating a relationship between them.","a2106d96-fe48-3db3-8a9d-53c9221c3b95":"Yes, these two requirements are related.

The second requirement describes the initialization process for Flight Software, where the Command and Control CSC (Component Support Component) initializes various aspects of the DPU FSW (Flight Software), including reading startup defaults from EEPROM or using hard-coded defaults if the checksum is bad.
