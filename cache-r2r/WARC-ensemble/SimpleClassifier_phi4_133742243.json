Therefore, they are not directly related.","14e53de8-e524-3fd2-ad2a-d9f8bdacdedd":"No. \n\nThe two requirements pertain to different programming languages and contexts. The first requirement specifies the implementation of a Python interface, while the second requires Libwarc to be implemented in C conforming to the ANSI-C standard C99 revision. There is no direct relationship between them based on the information provided.","8c55419e-5b13-39c0-a03d-5d597268fa13":"No.\n\nThe two requirements address different aspects of software development. The first requirement (NFR 9) pertains to licensing, specifying that the code and documentation should be licensed under an open source license. The second requirement (SRS 13) relates to functionality, stating that it should be possible to release a WARC-record using a destructor. These requirements are not directly related as they focus on different areas: one is about legal/licensing aspects, while the other concerns software design and behavior.","665702a0-bb5f-3c2e-a00b-673e6ccc7270":"No.\n\nThe two requirements pertain to different aspects of software development. The first requirement (NFR 17) focuses on coding constraints for a WARC API, specifically using C with minimal dependencies and avoiding assembly code. The second requirement (SRS 55) involves extending a WARC validator tool to optionally use the Jhove command line API for identifying and validating WARC files. While both relate to WARC file handling, they address different components and functionalities within the software development process."}
